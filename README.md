# Multivariable-Regression-with-Python
Multivariable Regression with Python 
linear regression using the gradient descent algorithm to predict profits based on a single input variable, population. The data is read from a CSV file and preprocessed to add a column of ones for the intercept term and normalize the data. The main functions include:
computeCost: calculates the cost function for linear regression 
gradientDescent: performs gradient descent to minimize the cost function 
The code also includes visualizations of the training data and the resulting linear regression model.
