Multivariable Regression with Python 
This code is a linear regression implementation using gradient descent algorithm. It takes a dataset file as input, processes the data by normalizing it and adding a column of ones, then applies the gradient descent algorithm to find the optimal values of theta that minimizes the cost function. The code also plots the training data and the predictions as well as the cost vs. training epoch. It is a simple yet powerful code that can be applied to a variety of linear regression problems.
